# Virtual Pet 

This is a virtual pet game where the user can create their own pet. 

## Introduction

The user will be given a brief description as to how the game works. They will be prompted to define a type for their pet
and give their pet a name.

## Game Loop

The game loop will consist of the user being offered the chance to make decisions for what to do with their pet. 
Actions include: 
- feeding
- watering
- playing fetch
- asking the pet to roll over
- asking the pet to shake
- having the pet sleep
- having the pet check the mail
 
The selection menu will give the user the option to enter "0" to look at their pets status menu.

Performing some tasks will affect others so it is important for the user to mindful of their pets status as they continue making selections. 

The pet may refuse to take certain actions if certain levels are too high or too low.
For example: if the pets hunger level is above 100 and you try to play fetch, the pet will refuse to play.

## Game End

The game will end if any one of a number of specific character status's reaches a certain level.
For example: the pets hunger level starts at 15, if it gets above 200 at any point, the game will end.
